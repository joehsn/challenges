# Algorithm for [B. Drinks](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/200/B) 

1. **Input:**
    - Read an integer `n` representing the number of numbers to be averaged.
2. **Initialization:**
    - Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.0 to store the sum of the numbers.
3. **Iterative Summation:**
    - For each number `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
        - Read an integer `p` representing the current number.
        - Add `p` to the `sum`.
4. **Calculate Average:**
    - Divide the `sum` by `n` to get the average.
5. **Output:**
    - Print the calculated average.
